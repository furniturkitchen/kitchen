Should I have 1 or 2 torsion springs on my garage door? From veterangaragedoor.com
If you have springs on the side of your garage door, then they are extension springs. This is the preferred spring system to have on a sectional roll up door. Your torsion springs are responsible for winding up the cables on the spools at the end of the shaft. If your garage door is standard aluminum less than 10 feet wide than almost always requires only 1 spring, compare to a same size wood door that normally has 2 springs.
