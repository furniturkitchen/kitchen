Why Is There An Ice Build Up In My Freezer Compartment AEG YouTube From youtube.com
Your ge refrigerator freezer can get stuck for a few reasons, either it’s got some sticky food residue on the seal, the door is locked, or ice has frozen it closed. After 1 hour of your freezer being open, ice will start to build up towards the opening of the freezer and more ice crystals will start to form in your food. This is a common problem that many people face when they forget to close the freezer door. When the freezer door is left open, food can get wet and spoil.
