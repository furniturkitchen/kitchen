But while calls are easy to make, they are not the most effective way to contact your member of congress or your senators.
Mr. Stewart&#39;s Blog October 2012 From jdstewart83.blogspot.com
How much do congressmen make before retirement? Lawmakers’ salaries do not include benefits like staff and travel allowances, which average. Since 2009, the congressional salary has been $174,000 per year, while those in leadership positions earn slightly above this rate. Say the everyday united states senator or united states congressman is going to be bringing in something like $174,000 per year.
