Reasons why cold weather drains out battery power Cold weather From pinterest.com
Your car battery doesn’t actually drain faster in cold, it’s just that cold causes the battery to have less voltage and capacity than normal, making it seem like it’s draining faster. When you’re working outside in the cold, slip the battery off the tool and pop it into your back pocket between applications. Lithium batteries perform better in extreme temperatures.
